    <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> I'm studying to be a Data Analyst and working part time at Blueberry Hill. Balancing this is very difficult, but I'm not the type to give up on a task I've selected. In my spare time I'm usually gaming, or watching videos online. And of course, sleeping. Nothing worse than working or coding when you're sleep deprived.

    <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> I took up data analytics because this era is extremely tech driven. I've always been fascinated with computers, but I want to put that fascination into a career.
